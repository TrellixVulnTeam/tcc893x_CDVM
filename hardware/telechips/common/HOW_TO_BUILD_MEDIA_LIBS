3. Window Audio codec
	This codec depends on Window media parser, so the parser must exist. 
	(1) Copy downloaded static library into hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/wmadec/lib.
			The library's name must have prefix lib.
			
	(2) Rename Android.mk_ to Android.mk in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/wmadec.
			If the library's name doesn't match with the content in Android.mk, 
			you should modify the name in Android.mk. 	

	(3)	Rename Android.mk_ to Android.mk in hardware/telechips/omx/omx_wmadec_component.

	(4)	Set "tcc.audio.support.wma" in hardware/telechips/common/tcc_audio_support.mk as '1'
			ex) tcc.audio.support.wma = 1 \

	(5)	Change value of wma related AudioDecoderCap to true at (ANDROID tree)/device/telechips/(CHIPSET)-common/media_profiles.xml
  		The .xml file will be changed as follows
		  --------------------------------------------
    		<AudioDecoderCap name="wma" enabled="true"/>
		  --------------------------------------------	

3. AC3 audio codec
	(1)	Make lib directory in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/ac3dec
	
	(2)	Copy downloaded static library into hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/ac3dec/lib. 
			The library's name must have prefix lib.

	(3) Rename Android.mk_ to Android.mk in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/ac3dec.			
			If the library's name doesn't match with the content in Android.mk, 
			you should modify the name in Android.mk. 

	(4)	Copy downloaded source folder, named omx_ac3dec_component, into hardware/telechips/omx/.
		  "hardware/telechips/omx/omx_ac3dec_component", like this.

	## Note : AC3 decoder and DDP decoder can not be applied simultaneously. ##
	(5) Set "tcc.audio.support.ac3" in hardware/telechips/common/tcc_audio_support.mk as '1'
			And "tcc.audio.support.ddp" must be set as '0' 
			
			ex) tcc.audio.support.ac3 = 1 \
					tcc.audio.support.ddp = 0 \

4. DDP audio codec
	(1)	Make lib directory in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/ddpdec
	
	(2) Copy downloaded static library into hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/ddpdec/lib.  
			The library's name must have prefix lib.

	(3) Rename Android.mk_ to Android.mk in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/ddpdec.						
			If the library's name doesn't match with the content in Android.mk, 
			you should modify the name in Android.mk. 

	(4) Copy downloaded source folder, named omx_ddpdec_component, into hardware/telechips/omx/.
		  "hardware/telechips/omx/omx_ddpdec_component", like this.
	

	## Note : AC3 decoder and DDP decoder can not be applied simultaneously. ##
	(5) Set "tcc.audio.support.ddp" in hardware/telechips/common/tcc_audio_support.mk as '1'
			And "tcc.audio.support.ac3" must be set as '0'

			ex) tcc.audio.support.ac3 = 0 \
					tcc.audio.support.ddp = 1 \
	
	Additionally, if DDP decoder is applied, you can use converting DDP to DD for spdif passthru.

	

5. DTS audio codec
	(1)	Make lib directory in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/dtsdec
	
	(2)	Copy downloaded static library into hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/dtsdec/lib.  
			The library's name must have prefix lib.
			
	(3)	Rename Android.mk_ to Android.mk in hardware/telechips/common/CDK/audio_codec/dtsdec.			
			If the library's name doesn't match with the content in Android.mk, 
			you should modify the name in Android.mk. 

	(4) Copy downloaded source folder, named omx_dtsdec_component, into hardware/telechips/omx/.
			"hardware/telechips/omx/omx_dtsdec_component", like this.

	(5)	Set "tcc.audio.support.dts" in hardware/telechips/common/tcc_audio_support.mk as '1'
			ex) tcc.audio.support.dts = 1 \

6. How to enable SPDIF output
	Even if you don't have AC3, DTS libraries, you can enable SPDIF output.
	Choose 'Passthrough' option at the SPDIF setting.
